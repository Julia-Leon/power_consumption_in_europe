# Power Consumption in Europe
  Energy is one of the most important needs in our society and it is very important to understand how it is managed. It has a high economic, social and environmental impact. Europe is one of the biggest consumers of energy in the planet and we will study its utilization.

### 1. Objective
  In this study we want to know if energy consumption is related to the population of a country.
  This study is focused in Western Europe and takes a sample of 15 countries of this region in a 6 years period (2015 to 2020).

### 2. Hypothesis
  We will base our analysis in the hypothesis that power consumption and population are related
  
  
### 3. Tools
 [**Dataset**](https://github.com/Julia-Leon/power_consumption_in_europe/tree/main/dataset): Power consumption per hour by country from 2015 to 2020
               Europe's population from 2011 to 2020
               
 [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://github.com/Julia-Leon/power_consumption_in_europe/blob/main/notebook/energy_by_country.ipynb): EDA, cleaning and wrangling with Python
 
 [**Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.leon4960/viz/PowerConsumptioninEurope/line_consyear): Wrangling and visualisations
 
### 4. Conclusions
  The [results assessment](https://github.com/Julia-Leon/power_consumption_in_europe/blob/main/presentation/POWER%20CONSUMPTION%20IN%20EUROPE.pdf) does not show a direct relation between power use and population and invalidate our hypothesis.
  
### 5. Further analysis
  The results obtained allow us to formulate new questions around the use of power per country, looking for which parameters affect to it and why, have a larger historical view of the variation in time or we can also try to figure out what causes each different pattern of energy consumption... and much more
