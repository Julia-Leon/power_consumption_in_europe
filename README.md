# Power Consumption in Europe
  Energy is one of the most important needs in our society and it is very important to understand how it is managed. It has a high economic, social and, last but not least,  environmental impact. Europe is one of the biggest conumers of energy in the planet and we will study its use in 15 countries in a 6 years period.

### 1. Objective
  In this study we want to know how energy consumption is related to the population of each region.
  
### 2. Tools
 [**Dataset**](https://github.com/Julia-Leon/power_consumption_in_europe/tree/main/dataset): Power consumption per hour by country from 2015 to 2020
               Europe's population from 2011 to 2020
               
 [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://github.com/Julia-Leon/power_consumption_in_europe/blob/main/notebook/energy_by_country.ipynb): EDA, cleaning and wrangling with Python
 
 [**Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.leon4960/viz/PowerConsumptioninEurope/line_consyear): Wranling and visualisations
